# Postmortem: Network Switch Misconfiguration Outage

# Issue Summary:

* Duration: February 17, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 17, 2024, 2:00 PM (GMT)
* Impact: The main service API endpoint experienced intermittent unavailability, resulting in a 30% increase in response times and partial service disruptions affecting approximately 15% of users.
* Root Cause: A misconfigured network switch caused intermittent packet loss, leading to degraded service performance.

# Timeline:

* 10:00 AM (GMT): Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times.
* Action Taken: Engineers investigated backend systems, database performance, and application logs to identify the root cause.
* Misleading Paths: Initially suspected issues with the database or application code were explored.
* Escalation: Incident escalated to the network operations team for further investigation.
* 2:00 PM (GMT): Misconfigured network switch identified and corrected, restoring normal service operations.

# Root Cause and Resolution:

* Root Cause: Misconfigured network switch in the data center caused intermittent packet loss, impacting communication between servers and clients.
* Resolution: Network engineers reconfigured the affected switch to resolve the packet loss issue and restore normal network connectivity.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:
## Improvements/Fixes:

* Implement regular network audits to identify and address misconfigurations promptly.
* Enhance monitoring systems to detect network anomalies in real-time.
* Develop a comprehensive incident response plan specifically for network-related issues.

## Tasks to Address the Issue:

* Schedule regular network audits to check for misconfigurations.
* Enhance network monitoring to include packet loss detection.
* Conduct a review of incident response procedures and update them to include network-related scenarios.

# Lessons Learned:

* Timely detection and escalation are critical during incidents to minimize impact and expedite resolution.
* Infrastructure components like network switches can have a significant impact on overall service availability.
* Regular audits and proactive monitoring are essential for identifying and addressing potential issues before they impact users.
